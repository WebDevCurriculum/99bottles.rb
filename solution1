** First Step: grab lyrics to song **
** Second Step - Think through code/organize program**
    - create a variable to store lyrics (no need for this one, can just print lyrics)
    - create a function that takes one away from the total number of beers
    - print out new number of beers 
    
    n = 99
    while n != 0
      puts n.to_s + " bottles of beer on the wall, " + n.to_s + " bottles of beer."
      puts "Take one down and pass it around, " + n.to_s + " bottles of beer on the wall."
  n = n - 1
    if n = 0
      puts "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall."
    end 
end
